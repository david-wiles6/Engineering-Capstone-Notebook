# Engineering Capstone Onshape

## Caster

### Base

This was a simple rectangle with 7 holes, 5 of those holes were patterned off of the sixth, and the 7th was in the middle of the left four holes as shown in this picture:

As you can see, I didn't draw the rectangle centered on the origin, so instead of putting the hole on the origin, I drew two lines for construction that were coincident with the top left and middle bottom holes and top middle and left bottom holes and put the hole on that intersection.

### Mount

This was a part that was based on the geometry of the base. The mount was a square with 5 holes in it, 4 in the corners and 1 in the middle. This part was made 3 different ways: one was making an entirely new part and drawing all of the holes in the same sketch as the square. The second was drawing the square first, then making the holes with two cuts and a pattern, this is the way I would do it in SolidWorks. The third was to use the geometry of the base and make an extrusion in the base part studio, and extrude it as new.

### Fork

This part was a circle with two prongs coming off the bottom, and one circular prong coming off the other side. In this part, I learned about how to do fillets.

### Tire

This part was a torus with the middle curve removed so the inside was flat. This was achieved by making a trapezoid and revolving it around an axis. This part taught me about doing revolves, which is significantly easier in Onshape than in SolidWorks.

### Wheel

This part was a rim. It was an I revolved around the origin. It had 5 holes cut in it. It was a bit tricky to do the circular pattern because I made a couple of silly mistakes, but otherwise it was pretty smooth sailing.

### Axle, Collar, Bearings

These parts were pretty easy, the axle was a cylinder with a notch cut into the top, the collar was on the end of the axle. One of the bearings went on the wheel, so I just used the wheel geometry to make a new part on top. Notably, I didn't have to make a new sketch for it which was cool, I just had to click the face, and extruded it as new to make the bearing. The other bearing I just made in a new part studio, this bearing goes on top of the fork, so I'm sure that I could have used the fork's reference geometry to make it if I wanted to.
