# Engineering Capstone Onshape

## Caster

### Base

This was a simple rectangle with 7 holes, 5 of those holes were patterned off of the sixth, and the 7th was in the middle of the left four holes as shown in this picture:

As you can see, I didn't draw the rectangle centered on the origin, so instead of putting the hole on the origin, I drew two lines for construction that were coincident with the top left and middle bottom holes and top middle and left bottom holes and put the hole on that intersection.
